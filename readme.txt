GM tools for World of Darkness

https://github.com/dunn0052/WoD

Often times new tabletop RPG players are more familiar to video games than the concept of roleplaying.
The intention of the fully built GM toolkit are to a) introduce new WoD players to character creation
and game mechanics b) help the GM manage the game so that they can worry less about the core mechanics
and more about the story they want to tell. c) evenutally become an easy to use generic tabletop RPG game
management tool which can be adapted to even the most convoluted of game systems. d) the ultimate goal
of having a fully integrated RPG table containing a seperate screen embedded in the table for each player
while including the ability to extend the system to laptops and other mobile devices.
